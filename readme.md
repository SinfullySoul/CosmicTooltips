# Cosmic Tooltips

A simple item tooltip mod for Cosmic Reach (Puzzle Loader).

Written very poorly because I have no experience with this kind of thing, so feel free to make fun of it.

## Features
- Tooltips when hovering over items in catalog and inventory/containers
- Press alt while hovering to see advanced info
- WAILA style display that shows the name and info of the block you're looking at
